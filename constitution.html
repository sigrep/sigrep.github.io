                        <h2>I. STATEMENT OF PURPOSE</h2>
						<p>The purpose of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) Special Interest Group on Representation Learning (the SIG) shall be to promote interest in Representation Learning in Natural Language Processing and Understanding (hereafter simply “representation learning”); to provide members of the ACL with a special interest in representation learning with a means of exchanging news of recent research developments and other matters of interest in representation learning; and to sponsor meetings and workshops in representation learning that appear to be timely and worthwhile, operating within the framework of the ACL's general guidelines for SIGs.</p>

(2) To prepare a written report on the activities of the SIG for the Executive Committee of the ACL, for presentation to the ACL at its Annual Business Meeting.</p>
                        
                        <p>The duties of the Secretary shall be: (1) To maintain a membership roster of the SIG. (2) To be responsible for any money awarded to the SIG by the ACL; and to present a written annual report on the SIG finances to the Executive Committee of the ACL. (3) To act as a Liaison Representative, who shall be primarily responsible for communication with members of the SIG, answering inquiries about the SIG, and communication with the Executive Committee of the ACL.</p>
                        
                        <p>The joint duties of the President and Secretary shall be to oversee the organisation of a Senior Organising Committee (SOC). Members to this committee must be selected from the SIG membership, and preferably have had some previous involvement in the organisation of RepL4NLP or other events associated with the SIG. Members can be added to, or removed from, the SOC at any point, subject to the joint approval of the President and Secretary.</p>

The SOC will be responsible for ensuring that the organisation of SIG-associated events upholds the highest standards of academic practice and diversity.</p>
